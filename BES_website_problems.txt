BES data links
- missing Wave 9 only link! (it's there, but you have to google for that one specifically rather than finding it with the rest)
- Wave 12 and Wave 11 broken links for Questionnaire pdf (both point to wave 13)
- British Election Study Combined Wave 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 Internet Panel
   - Stata and questionnaire links broken!
   
- pedantic point added for completeness
   - 7z zip file format a bit less friendly compared to vanilla zip format
   - only used twice (W7_comb, W8_comb)
