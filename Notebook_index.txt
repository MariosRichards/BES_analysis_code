Variable Distributions ?

Political axis positioning ?
-> blank, what did I intend to put here?
-> probably wanted to compare and contrast movement of axes over different time periods!

Process flow:
=============

Load and pre-process data ?
Reduce and transform data ?
Impute Missing Values ?






1: BES Wave 8 Building Clean Data Subsets
-----------------------------------------
- BES2015_W8_v1.3.dta
- initial attempt at removing Weasel Words
- zero variance columns
- personality_variables
- ^look specifically at rows where euRefVote is not null
- only look at England and Yes/No euRefVote
- using seaborn to make nice looking (subjective!) graphs
- using anderson_ksamp for significant testing


2: BES_Data_Extraction
----------------------
- Get wave 8 dataset (BES2015_W8_v1.3.dta)
- replicate EP Kaufmann graphs (death penalty/income by EU ref vote)


3: Decomposition
----------------
- Nice semi human friendly way to knock out PCA output
- attempted automated clustering (not really impressive!)
- autogenerated scatter plots of ordinal/non-ordinal variables
- autogenerated kde plots of ordinal/non-ordinal variables
- everything saved sensibly in folders
   - "BES_data_folder/Treatment/Decomp_method/"
- weighted kde! (using BES weights!)
- weighted PCA!
- analysis of what Left/Right means
(i.e. is UKIP *really* more leftwing than Greens/Labour?
-> in the context of ec.left/right vs soc. con/lib
-> vs parties


4: Differentiate variables by scale and type
--------------------------------------------
- BES2015_W8_Panel_v1.3.dta
- analysis of variables by dtype
- lumping category variables by their sets of categories
- categories defined by pre-processing to ordinality needs
- W_8Panel_semi_cleaned ?? once upon a time saved clean version here
- W8Panel_numerics_only.hdf save here instead
- 'euRefcols' EU ref vote columns!
- attempt to standardise output for PCA, but caused memory error


5: Going back to W8 dataset
---------------------------
- BES2015_W8_v1.3.dta
- variable_categories function
- quick graphs for (newspaper/registered)
- attempt to group and list all category variables
- define set of 'weasel' non answers
- reorder categories to be ordinal (more ordinal!)
- toss out weasel words and non-ordinal values -> BES_numerics_only
- BES_reduced = england + half-complete variables
- clean_feature_set_nonan = BES_reduced.fillna(BES_reduced.mean())
- PCA look at components (soc. con-lib/lr-scale/age/political awareness/information source)
- Look at the different PCA algorithms (FastICA, FactorAnalysis)
   - Factor Analysis has a weird order effect
- age and Age out by 2 years (so ... yougov signup date mismatch?)


6: PCA and LDA
--------------
- uses W8Panel_numerics_only
- clean_feature_set_nonan uses fillna(mean)
- X_std = clean_feature_set_std sklearn StandardScaler
- PCA (currently has error) FIXED
- peeking at 'personality agreeableness'
- LDA attempt (bit unclear still!) -> gives you a 1D output


7: Reducing data & inspecting missing value distribution
--------------------------------------------------------
- uses W8Panel_numerics_only
	- uses BES_Panel but only to create masks
- variable_categories/type function
- Looking at "coverage" (ques that receive ans/respondent receive ans)
- Can cut by
	euRef answered
	England (some ques partitioned by England/Wales/Scotland)
- save covariance matrix


8: Weighted Multivariate KDE
----------------------------
- exploring different ways of inferring multivariate kernel density estimates (e.g. distribution of underlying data from finite sample) - specifically
- distributions that are more 2+ dimensional (because we want to look at *at least* first two components)
- distributions that are weighted (because we have BES population weightings and they have a significant impact on what the distribution looks like - specifically, people who respond to BES surveys are more 'political' than non-respondents - lot more disinterest in the general population - easy to over emphasise political interest!)
- upshot of this? I found a better way to do it


9: Tidier Version ??
-----------------
Load BESPanel stata file
(download if does not exist!)
Reduce dataset to England Only and EuRef Leave/Stay

Transform data (modify categories, weasel words -> nan, drop some categories of questions)
* Need to add some regular expression to get rid of W8, W1W2W3, _W1232445


10: LD2010 to UKIP2015
----------------------
- # What's up with people who voted LD in 2010 and UKIP in 2015?
















































Remove Zero Variance questions
Remove Zero Answer questions
Remove Zero Answer individuals

Fill in Missing Values

Analysis (PCA etc)


< Think about 'core representative sample group' > (cross-section weight - one for 'core representative sample', one for everyone in wave)
< Scotland, England, Wales and London > Separate regions in data?
< England, Scotland and Wales> Have separate questions (Scotland gets a lot on scot ref, leaves space for a different set in England/Wales)
Top-up items asked in first wave someone participates in < Occupation, Parent's occupation, Country of birth, Highest education level, Left-right values>
Yougov fills in a load from their database <Age, Highest qualification, Home ownership, Marital status, Age left education (we already have highest qualification), Ethnicity, Local authority and education authority, Household income, Personal income, Household size, Number of children in household, Preferred daily newspaper, Vote choice in 2010, Religiosity, Religious denomination, Type of organization worked for, Big 5 personality measures>
Playground items (only for English, and not always in every wave)
Campaign items - Wave 5 has subsets asked on different days of campaign, made a note of which day
Coming later - manual coding for MII questions, question orderings as they appeared (some were randomised), question timings































Should create a list of variables:

Directly related to EuRefVote (euRefVote, euRefVote2 ...) DONE
Directly related to EU referendum

OneHotEncoding for non-ordinal categoricals

Collinear Variables?

Give FancyImpute a try!





Note on the EU referendum questions:
During waves 7 and 8, respondents were asked which way they intended to vote in the EU referendum
and then respondents who said donâ€™t know were asked a follow-up squeeze question. In wave 8
respondents were also asked about whether they had applied for a postal vote and whether they had
voted with it.
euRefVote- Combines the squeezed and unsqueezed responses and postal votes where applicable
euRefVoteUnsqueeze- Just the unsqueezed responses (excluding postal votes)
euSqueeze- Just the squeezed responses
euRefVotePost- just the postal vote responses




HYPOTHESES

(1) Questions with different fgfgW8 ghgfW7 should have the same answer options

Falsified ... but, so far, only in cases where
(a) option sets differ by weasel words
(b) there's an actual error with the data!
(c) some regional stuff (localElection - PlaidCymru/SNP options!)
(d) some stuff that's actually just changed (miilabel)


(2) Can we extend the matching process for questions? BlahW8W7W6?
or Blah5/Blah_5 and Blah6/Blah_6?


ERRORS IN DATASET

- Questions with category sets:
(a) Of size 1
(b) category sets differ between BlahW2 and BlahW3 (sometimes minor - addition/subtraction of Weasel Word - sometimes major error)


We need to flag these - to pass to BES, to fix manually and to mask/remove
