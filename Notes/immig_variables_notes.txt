changeImmig
"Do you think that [The level of immigration is] getting higher, getting lower or staying about the same?"
- no change in first shift, huge change in second shift

changeImmigLab +
"If there were a *Labour* UK government today, do you think that [The level of immigration is] would be getting higher, getting lower or staying about the same?

controlImmig ++++
"How much control do you think Britain has over immigration to the UK? (W8)"
"After Britain negotiates leaving terms with the EU, how much control do you think Britain will have over immigration to the UK (W9)"
huge shift W8->W9
slight shift back W9->W10 (A lot of control -> Some control)

asylumMore - just small towards disliking it less
euMore/noneuMore ++
substantial shift W8->W13 from Many Fewer -> Neutral (on top of intermediate steps)

similar with families/students
-> think in terms of distribution of step shift (i.e. mostly 0, but where is mode? maybe Don't Know and Neutral should be merged?)

effectsEUImmigration ++
"Do you think [Immigration to the UK] would be higher, lower or about the same if the UK leaves the European Union?"
W7->W8 increased conviction leaving EU would make imm much lower
W8->W10 massively decreased - steady thereafter

euPriorityBalance W10-W13
"Brexit priority: access to single market versus controlling immigration?"
Hard to read, but surprisingly static
(maybe try with reduced categories?)

eumiismall - boring!

miilabel W1-6
- interesting
- Don't know and Immigration quite stable categories
- 'economy general' had 'weakest gravity'
- RERUN with just ECON/IMM/DK/OTHER



Correlations with al_scale (al_scale averaged over whole period)

immigCultural, immigEcon, immigrantsWelfareState
W1->W8 mono rise, W8->W10 sharp drop, W10-W13 rise
- cultural less change, more static

immigSelf - much more static - W8->W9 v small drop, not sure if last two results reliable

euPriorityBalance mono inc W10->W13



(overall top -corr with al_Scale immigSelf (+XMore/immigEcon *not* immigCultural!),
