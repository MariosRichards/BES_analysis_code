Immigration Variables Observations

- link to Rob Ford's medium, maybe also the recent ipsos mori poll on it
https://medium.com/@robfordmancs/how-have-attitudes-to-immigration-changed-since-brexit-e37881f55530
- purpose of notes

- dataset



* immigration variables - do they represent one underlying thing or is there complex underlying structure
Factor Analysis - pretty much just one thing
immigEcon, immigCultural, immigSelf, immigrantsWelfareState, euPriorityBalance





[* immigrationNarrower -> Bayesian Belief Plot]


* Mean variable position by wave

* immigration variables - sankey
- how they've changed





* ChangeMind raw correlations
- BES_reduced variable setup (DK's/NaNs mean replaced, categories to numbers or dummied)







[* Correlation with authoritarianism over waves]












Footnotes

[1] There's a lot of interesting structure - but it's all second-order party-political stuff, next three components are basically BlameLabour Yes/No, BlameConservatives Yes/No, UKIP Yay/Boo

[2] Ipsos Mori saw the same thing in their own dataset, but find people who are pro-immigration more stable - not clear if that's a confound with nowhere to go from "most favourable" when there's a shift in favour of immigration, but I would hazard they accounted for that: https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/shifting-ground-attitudes-towards-immigration-and-brexit

[3] Some winnowing on coverage, dropping/mean-replacing DKs, linear-ish variables turned into numbers, categorical variables dummied). I left directly related variables in there as a sanity check (/reasonable baseline /laziness).
