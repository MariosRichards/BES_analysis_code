WEDNESDAY BES stuff
===================


* general process for amalgamating multiple waves (have to decide priority to older/newer waves) using fillna with bfill/ffill options
- .bfill(axis=1).iloc[:, 0]







- trying to moderate memory of BES_redueced dataframes

- panda 0.24 allows for int arrays with nans ... but isn't quite out yet




BES_reduced_with_na.info(memory_usage='deep')

gl_float.apply(pd.to_numeric,downcast='float')



* update file extraction
* update grab W14

* update -> make filenames OS-acceptable 

* made (W1->W2) variable names cleare (incl. top category) DONE



* kind of inconvenient having some variable data in new_old_names and some in var_type
- e.g. variables that didn't make into BES_reduced

* Run into problems using BES_Panel directly (to whit - it's not reliable!)

* why are we using BES_Panel? Seems like the only reason is
- easier to infer range than BES_reduced (already normed?)
- not missing low coverage series


* decent key for var types!


#

# types
# -99 - Uncategorised!
# -5 - id
# -4 - text
# -3 - datetimes
# -2 - ignore_list
# -1 - weights/wave indicators/campaign day indicators/miilabeluncertainty
# 0 - personality measures (in steps of .5?), personality_agreeableness ...etc, riskScale
# 1 - linear category, just use  (some made linear by dropping "Weasel_answers")
# 2 - categories need to be modified - order changed
# 3 - set of non-ordered options
# 4 - indirect variables - did someone fill something in in the free text box or not?
# 5 - categories need to modified - things removed
    # not so clear when this one applies - is it supposed to be whenever weasel words are removed?
    # or when variables are *changed*
# 6 - categories are integers - should maybe be transformed directly into numbers (mostly "how much money do people need minimum/well off"?)
# 7 - soc2010(W3-6_comb,W5_only), v1(W5_comb), RandomIDW1(W3-6_comb), mapNames(W3_only), mapNamesW3 (W3-10_comb,W13_comb)        
# 8 - pano, electoratepcon, <party>sh10pcon, turnout10pcon, winnersh10pcon, runnerupsh10pcon, marginsh10pcon
#     all relate to parliamentary constituency (pano applies to different waves - rest are about 2010 general election)
# 9 - 'cciW1W2W3W4W5','ccinoITW1W2W3W4W5','justITW1W2W3W4W5','cciW6W7W8W9','ccinoITW6W7W8W9','justITW6W7W8W9'
#     floats - otherwise, no idea what these variables are!
#     they are 0/1 - look like wave related indicator variables


# [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 4, 7, 8, 9] -> meta list
# [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6] -> 

# ordinal: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6
# non-ordinal: 3, 7

# load question_categories_correct.csv
# sanity check by type!
# turn into list of variables by type
# 1, 5 handled the same way -> cat.codes
# 6 -> int()
# 4 ignored
# 3 ignored for now (-> vectorized?)
# 2 direct modification
