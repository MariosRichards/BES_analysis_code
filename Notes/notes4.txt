Votes for EU citizens: https://medium.com/@robfordmancs/nic-o-nas-bez-nas-why-voting-rights-for-eu-citizens-should-be-on-the-political-agenda-ff991b05b22b


I think the observation on value space of the electorate is obviously spot on.

That throws up two questions:
(i) Is this about representation of people in the UK, regardless of whether or not they vote? Because that would notionally include all non-UK citizens (EU citizens/non-EU-non-UK residents) and people under the age of 18.

(ii) If it's specifically about votes, then I think you've got to be wary about assuming that turnout is primarily a function of proximity in value space - i.e. left-wing authoritarians *would* turnout in high numbers if only they had a party to vote for.

They did turnout in 97 though and 50% + were Labour]

What I have in mind is less a sharp distinction between "Always Vote"/"Never Vote" but a soft tendency to have a consistently lower baseline tolerance for parliamentary democracy.

[Paula Surridge

Looking at some data yesterday that suggests the Liberal Left are least satisfied with 'how democracy works'; problem is it is heavily conditioned by whether you support the current party of government.]

I.e. an equivalently-value-matched pitch to voters in different areas of the political compass always leads to turnout increases - but significantly different levels depending on position (and with different levels of sustainability over the course of multiple elections).

Alternatively, another way of thinking about it is that "equivalently-value-matched pitches" are bogus because we(I?) implicitly think of pitches as being bounded by the limitations of parliamentary democracy, while the public has preferences that go well beyond that.

I'm edging towards another "your depressing reading is right, but insufficiently depressing" argument.

The "unmet need" isn't just a more explicitly left-UKIP.

I think if you look at that *huge* mass of left/centre-authoritarians and ask what would satisfy them *as much as liberal democracy tends to satisfy socially liberal left/centre/right wing people* ...

... I think the answer is Fidesz - expl. moving away from parl. democracy.

That presents an issue because you're looking at preferences which are not ~independent of the process which you're ideally holding static - even if only because it makes it hard to analyse electoral politics if the rules are included as a variable.

I'm not saying it's illegitimate or factually wrong - just that at the point where you're thinking about fully satisfying the political preferences of people who would prefer something like Fidesz

I think you have to start also thinking about 16 year olds and resident EU citizens - people currently outside the space of current "politically satisfiable electorate" but not outside the space of notionally "politically satisfiable electorate".
