4+ pomodoros
notebook: Bayesian Belief Network
output: al&lr_by_leftRight
- (re)setting up Bayesian Belief Networks (reinstalling R/Rstudio/reacquiring bnlearn library)
- looking at interactions between core values (lr/al variables) and leftRight self placement
- some bonus files with related extra variables thrown in (confusing!)
- obs: leftRight always linked to lr1 and al2 (al1 added in W13 -> presumably age-shift)
-      
- lr2/lr5/al3 least connected/most 'downstream' lr/al vars

- lr4->al2, lr1->al5
- lr4->al2, lr1->al5
- lr4->al2, lr3->al5
- lr4<-al2, lr4->al1, lr2<-al4
- lr4<-al2, lr4<-al3, lr3<-al4
-           lr3<-al1, lr1<-al4

"There is one law for the rich and one for the poor" <-> "death penalty"
- if you run it on all waves simultaneously, you get ... a very confusing result
  leftRight places mostly based on other leftRight variables *and lr1* variables and a bit of al1 (if ethno and populism are in the mix, then it's back to lr1 and al2)

Saturday-Sunday 24-25/02/2018
- whole dataset (at least, all ordinal variables) Bayesian Belieft Network inference (still only takes ~3 minutes)
- tried different inference algorithms
- looking into some means of actually visualising the resulting output that doesn't require just manually zooming in on pdfs!

Monday 26/02/2018
- looking at interesting causal interactions it throws up - e.g. Party Membership and Private School

Tuesday 27/02/2018
- Labour held constituencies/marginals x Labour Leave/Labour Remain
- all the other weird pairs
- figured out how to bootstrap lots of bayesian networks in bnlearn - probably overnight run 500x 3 minutes = 25 hrs? Hmmm
