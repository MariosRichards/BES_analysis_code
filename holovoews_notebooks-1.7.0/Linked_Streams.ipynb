    "In previous notebooks we discovered how the [DynamicMap](Dynamic_Map.ipynb) class allows us to declare objects in a lazy way to enable exploratory analysis of large parameter spaces. In the [Streams](Streams.ipynb) tutorial we learned how to interactively push updates to existing plots by declaring Streams on a DynamicMap. In this tutorial we will extend the idea to so called **linked** Streams, which allow declaring complex interactions by exposing events generated by interacting with a plot. Being able to succinctly capture interactions with a plot and defining a simple Python based callback to define the interactivity allows generating much richer visualizations, revealing more detail about your data.\n",
