Rather than trying to replace these plotting libraries, HoloViews is a set of tools for working with complex datasets, annotating your data with just enough metadata to make it instantly visualizable. Of course, all the real work is done by the underlying plotting libraries, with HoloViews plotting backends making it possible for you to avoid worrying about all those details in day-to-day work.\n",

No one would curate the specific pixels representing 2.0 above, because they know they can always effortlessly regenerate them when needed, and just storing the raw data alone isn't sufficient either, because it doesn't capture enough of the domain knowledge to be interpretable directly.  If instead of using HoloViews you had built a plot directly using the underlying plotting program, then each time you wanted to do the above operations (sampling, slicing, faceting, animating, etc.), you would need to recapitulate all of the semantic metadata into the options for this new plot, which is time consuming, error prone, and would generate large amounts of domain-specific code that you would then need to maintain.\n",

    "If you want to use HoloViews interactively at the Jupyter prompt, all you need to know is that if you refer to a HoloViews object (which we call a \"view\") at the Jupyter prompt, you'll get a plot, in precisely the same way that if you put something evaluating to 2 at such a prompt you'll see the character \"2\".  But if you're the sort of person who really wants to know how all that actually works, e.g. if you want to use HoloViews outside of Jupyter, read on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rendering Python scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's think about what happens if you type `x` at a Python prompt, having previously done `x=2`, and you see some pixel pattern that you can read as \"2\".  Your computer starts with some information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **data**: the bit pattern 00000010\n",
    "- **metadata**: the fact that the data is an integer and not a float or an ASCII character\n",
    "- **display-options**: the numerical base for printing (decimal, binary, hex, etc.), number of digits, whether to use a leading zero, etc., and other aspects of coming up with a string representation for a number\n",
    "- **rendering_options**: your terminal or browser's default fonts, colors, etc., which are used to turn strings into pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "Here your actual data is just a tiny chunk of memory, which isn't interpretable without the associated metadata (semantic information) that declares what it is, and even then isn't displayable without the associated option settings (even if never made explicitly) that determine how you want to see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from this information, you also need some code:\n",
    "- **make_obj()**: Construct a Python object holding the data and metadata (i.e., the Python integer 2, not just the bare bit pattern for 2)\n",
    "- **make_str()**: Use the resulting obj and the str-options to create a string representation for the obj, which in Python is orchestrated by the integer ``__str__`` method.  \n",
    "- **render()**: Using code in your terminal program, OS, or web browser for taking a string and some rendering_options, turn it into visible pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the whole sequence of steps from constructing a Python scalar to seeing the result at the Python prompt will end up evaluating code like:\n",

    "``\n",
    "renderer(make_str(make_obj(data,metadata), display_options), rendering_options)\n",
    "``\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rendering HoloViews objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost precisely the same series of steps happens for HoloViews objects.  For the sine grating example above, you start with some information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **data**: the array of floating-point values sampled from the sine function\n",
    "- **metadata**: the fact that the data is sampled from a continuous function, the text label for the data (\"Sine Grating\"), the names of each dimension (\"x\",\"y\"), etc.\n",
    "- **plot_options**: whether to add a title, legend, etc. -- settings controlling how HoloViews builds a plot\n",
    "- **style_options**: line color, line style, background color, etc. -- settings passed on to the Bokeh or Matplotlib backend\n",
    "- **rendering_options**: HTML figure size, PNG height and width, etc. -- settings controlling how your final plot is rendered from a Bokeh or Matplotlib figure once created\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to displaying Python strings, here we have two separate types of display options, depending on whether HoloViews is the one consuming the options (`plot_options`), or whether they are passed down unchanged to the underlying Bokeh or Matplotlib backend (`style_options`).  As before, you also need some code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **make_obj()**: Construct a HoloViews object (`hv.Curve()`, `hv.Image()`, etc.) to store the data and metadata  \n",
    "- **make_plot()**: given a HoloViews object and the plot-options, construct a plotting object using a particular plotting backend (Matplotlib, Bokeh, etc.) and pass the style-options to that backend for its use\n",
    "- **render()**: given a plot constructed by one of the backends, along with the renderer-options, render that plot as something immediately viewable in a given context (i.e., a PNG, HTML code, etc.)\n",
