Grand Narrative

Re: Lib/Auth



* How do Values Interact?
*(1) Lib-Auth axis conditions corr/lack of corr between ec. Left-Right axis (J. Mellon et al)
	-> ? Auth responsible for corr between direct effect of economy on pop. shifts on ec. Left-Right axis?
*(1a) This explains the disparity between HoC and public social attitudes distribution
	-> left-authoritarians can never have good representation
	-> will always be the basis of grumpy populism
*(1b) HoC(/any representative body) will always be more ec. Right and Lib than the general population
	-> or, to put it another way, commentators will *always* be observing, in a surprised tone, that the general population is a great deal more left-wing/social conservative
	than the political consensus
*(1c) Centre-left parties have a built-in coalitional problem
	-> maybe this explains the consistent performance asymmetry between centre-left/centre-right parties over the last century


* Where Do Values Come From?
*(2) (One source at least) is governments
*(2a) Primary influence is not current government, but government when you were when 13-18/20-22
	-> link to age-influence graph / graph comparing attitudes vs gov at 15
*(2b) Just *your own* government? What about superpowers? Fall of Berlin wall?
*(2c) Is it about governments positionally - or that being elected is a public sign of success?
	-> Basically, do the Nazis in 1945 count as a government that inspires the uptake of socially conservative values
		- or an example of failure, with the American victors having a much greater impact



* But What's Different Now?
(3) Um ... something something
	- Berlin Wall falls, reduced salience of Communist outgroup (space now filled by railing against social liberals









* But Wait, There's More!
(4) Whitehall Experiments
	- Abstract social grade -> bigger health impact than smoking/diet
