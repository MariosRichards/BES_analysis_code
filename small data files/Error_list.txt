"disabilitydisability profile Are your day-to-day activities limited because of a health problem or disability?
Yes, limited a lot|Yes, limited a little|No"
and W6_only variable "disability"
and
"Do you have any long-term illness, health problem or disability which limits your daily activities or the work you can do? Include problems which are due to old age
"Yes|No|Don’t know"
in every wave but 

Mostly distinguised because in all datasets other than W6_only it's "disabilityW6" rather than yougov's "disability"
... but even that screws with any code that assumes that the variables are related
-> I suggest clearer rename

yougov "disability" -> rename to "profile_disability"
if "disability" in BES_Panel.columns && dataset != W6_only
