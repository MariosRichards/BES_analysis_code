* Weird inconsistency about whether or not to have *what I assume* is a "Did not vote" option
- same variable in other waves is just No|Yes|Don't know
"No|Yes|3.0|Don't know":
   ["No","Yes","Did not vote","Don't know"], # regretsIHaveAFewEUW10|regretsIHaveAFewEUW11

* "disability" - collision between the name of a yougov profile variable "disability"
"disabilitydisability profile Are your day-to-day activities limited because of a health problem or disability?
Yes, limited a lot|Yes, limited a little|No"
and W6_only variable "disability"
and
"Do you have any long-term illness, health problem or disability which limits your daily activities or the work you can do? Include problems which are due to old age
"Yes|No|Don’t know"
in every wave but 

Mostly distinguised because in all datasets other than W6_only it's "disabilityW6" rather than yougov's "disability"
... but even that screws with any code that assumes that the variables are related
-> I suggest clearer rename

* ageGroup W1_only doesn't include "Under 18" as a category  

* remove "Â" and "Ã‚Â" from cat lists - seem to appear near £ signs

* need to load W13_comb/W10_comb to check this - is 2.0 instead of "Don't know"? 
"No, did not vote|Yes, voted|2.0|99.0|Don't know"
