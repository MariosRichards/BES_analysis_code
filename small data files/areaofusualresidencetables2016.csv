"1 The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act (HFEA) 2008 contained provisions enabling two females in a same sex couple to register a birth from 1 September 2009 onwards. Due to the small numbers, births registered to a same sex couple in a marriage or civil partnership (1,011 in 2016) are included with marital births while births registered to a same sex couple outside a marriage or civil partnership (393 in 2016) are included with births outside marriage. Births registered under HFEA are reported only for England and Wales and no sub division thereof.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3 The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is the average number of live children that a group of women would bear if they experienced the age-specific fertility rates of the calendar year in question throughout their childbearing lifespan.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
     The national TFRs have been calculated using the number of live births by single year of age.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
     The sub-national TFRs have been calculated using the number of live births by five year age groups.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4 Maternities per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44. A maternity is a pregnancy resulting in the birth of one or more children, including stillbirths.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

     The England and Wales and elsewhere figures correspond to figures published at the national level for England and Wales not based on area of usual residence. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
